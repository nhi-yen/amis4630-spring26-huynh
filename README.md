AMIS 4630 Buckeye Marketplace Project

<h1>Buckeye Marketplace</h1>

<p>
Buckeye Marketplace is a student-focused peer-to-peer marketplace designed to help Ohio State students buy and sell pre-owned textbooks, dorm items, and class supplies safely and efficiently. The system is grounded in user research from Milestone 1, including personas and a journey map that identified pain points around cluttered browsing, unclear listings, unreliable seller communication, and safety concerns when meeting strangers.
</p>

<h2>Architecture Decisions</h2>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
  <li>React was selected for the frontend to support fast, responsive browsing and reusable UI components.</li>
  <li>.NET Web API was selected for the backend to provide reliable product data access and buyer–seller messaging.</li>
  <li>SQL was selected for structured storage of users, products, messages, and meetup details.</li>
  <li>GitHub Projects was used for feature prioritization and Kanban-based workflow management.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>
All design and architecture documentation for Milestone 2 is stored in the <code>/docs</code> folder:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>System Architecture Diagram</li>
  <li>Database Schema Design (ERD)</li>
  <li>Architecture Decision Records (ADR)</li>
  <li>Component Architecture (Atomic Design)</li>
</ul>

<h3>AI Tool Usage</h3>

<p>
